## Project Description
### Question of interest
- What factors may cause certain students to perform better than others?
### Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because
 1. A student's school performance tells of their success later in life and potential careers. 
 2. “Academic performance is important for students as a result of educational experience in colleges to represent knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Academic performance becomes one of the key factors in determining students’ success in their future careers.”  [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2022.2101326#:~:text=Academic%20performance%20is%20important%20for,success%20in%20their%20future%20careers)
#### Data Source
I chose this [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/student-study-performance) on which my visualizations were based. This data set lists multiple key factors influencing students' performances. Some categories include gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and the completion of a test preparation course.
##### Interpreting Visualizations

**Figure 1:** I analyzed the math, reading, and writing scores by gender using a bar graph. This graph shows that in almost all three sections, females scored higher than males. Males scored only 5 points higher than females in the math section. By analyzing only this data set, one can conclude that females overall scored higher than males during testing.

** Figure 2:** I focused on the parental education section. The possibilities for parental education were high school, some high school, some college, a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree, or a master's degree. In this visualization, I choose to use a horizontal bar graph to represent the data. This chart shows an obvious trend between parents' education and the student's success in the math section. For the most part, parents who have received higher education levels correlated positively with the student's math scores.

**Figure 3:** This demonstrates the variation of people who had completed the preparation vs those who did not and their average scores on each section. The scatter plot shows that those who completed the preparation scored higher than those who did not in each section.
