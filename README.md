# Project Description
## Question of interest
- What factors may cause certain students to perform better than others?
## Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because
 1. A student's school performance tells of their success later in life and potential careers. 
 2. “Academic performance is important for students as a result of educational experience in colleges to represent knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Academic performance becomes one of the key factors in determining students’ success in their future careers.”  [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2022.2101326#:~:text=Academic%20performance%20is%20important%20for,success%20in%20their%20future%20careers)

# Data Description and Upload
I chose this [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/student-study-performance) for my visualizations. This data set lists multiple key factors influencing students' performances. The categories include gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and the completion of a test preparation course. The data set provides the students' math, reading, and writing scores based on those given factors. Within my visualizations, I focus on the student's average scores within each category. I specifically studied gender, parental education level, and test preparation completion. These factors, in my opinion, are most influential and could provide the best information to answer my question. You can find this data in the files within my repository. 

To display these visualizations, I used [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/DataVisualizationandStoryTellingFinalProject/SubjectScorebyGender?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Given my data and the answers I was looking for, I felt that Tableau would be most effective. I used their visualizations and tools on Tableau to display my data best.  

# Interpreting Visualizations

### **Figure 1:** 
I first chose to analyze the math, reading, and writing scores by gender using a vertical bar graph. This graph shows that females scored higher in almost all three sections than males. Males scored, on average, only 5 points higher than females in the math section. By analyzing only this data set, one can conclude that females scored higher than males overall during testing. This proves that gender plays a significant role in a student's performance in school. However, it's important to investigate further factors beyond gender that might contribute to these score differences, such as parental education or test preparation, to understand student performance comprehensively.

### **Figure 2:** 
Next, I focused on the parental education section. The possibilities for parental education were high school, some high school, some college, a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree, or a master's degree. In this visualization, I chose to use a horizontal bar graph to represent the average math scores in relation to parental education. This chart shows an obvious trend between parents' education and the student's success in the math section. Parents with higher education levels correlated mostly positively with the student's math scores. Analyzing the relationship between parental education and student performance sheds light on how family background and parental involvement can significantly influence academic achievement.

### **Figure 3:** 
Lastly, I analyzed test preparation and its effect on students' performance. This visualization demonstrates the variation of people who had completed the preparation vs. those who did not and their average scores on each section. The scatter plot shows that those who completed the preparation scored overall higher than those who did not in each section. This further proves the importance of test preparation for students' performance. By highlighting the impact of test preparation on performance disparities, this data provides insight into how access to resources and opportunities for preparation can influence students' academic outcomes, addressing the question of what factors may cause certain students to perform better than others.
