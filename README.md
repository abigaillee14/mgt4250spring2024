# Project Description
## Question of interest
- What factors may cause certain students to perform better than others?
## Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because
 1. A student's school performance tells of their success later in life and potential careers. 
 2. “Academic performance is important for students as a result of educational experience in colleges to represent knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Academic performance becomes one of the key factors in determining students’ success in their future careers.”  [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2022.2101326#:~:text=Academic%20performance%20is%20important%20for,success%20in%20their%20future%20careers)

# Data Description and Upload
I chose this [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/student-study-performance) for my visualizations. This data set lists multiple key factors influencing students' performances. The categories include gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and the completion of a test preparation course. The data set provides the students' math, reading, and writing scores based on those given factors. Within my visualizations, I focus on the student's average scores within each category. I specifically studied gender, parental education level, and test preparation completion. These factors, in my opinion, are most influential and could provide the best information to answer my question. You can find this data in the files within my repository. 

To display these visualizations, I used [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/DataVisualizationandStoryTellingFinalProject/SubjectScorebyGender?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Given my data and the answers I was looking for, I felt that Tableau would be most effective. I used their visualizations and tools on Tableau to display my data best.  

# Interpreting Visualizations

### **Figure 1:** 
I first chose to analyze the math, reading, and writing scores by gender using a vertical bar graph. This graph shows that females scored higher in almost all three sections than males. Males scored, on average, only 5 points higher than females in the math section. By analyzing only this data set, one can conclude that females scored higher than males overall during testing. This proves that gender plays a significant role in a student's performance in school. However, it's important to investigate further factors beyond gender that might contribute to these score differences, such as parental education or test preparation, to understand student performance comprehensively.

### **Figure 2:** 
Next, I focused on the parental education section. The possibilities for parental education were high school, some high school, some college, a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree, or a master's degree. In this visualization, I chose to use a horizontal bar graph to represent the average math scores in relation to parental education. This chart shows an obvious trend between parents' education and the student's success in the math section. Parents with higher education levels correlated mostly positively with the student's math scores. Analyzing the relationship between parental education and student performance sheds light on how family background and parental involvement can significantly influence academic achievement.

### **Figure 3:** 
Lastly, I analyzed test preparation and its effect on students' performance. This visualization demonstrates the variation of people who had completed the preparation vs. those who did not and their average scores on each section. The scatter plot shows that those who completed the preparation scored overall higher than those who did not in each section. This further proves the importance of test preparation for students' performance. By highlighting the impact of test preparation on performance disparities, this data provides insight into how access to resources and opportunities for preparation can influence students' academic outcomes, addressing the question of what factors may cause certain students to perform better than others.

In conclusion, while gender, parental education, and test preparation emerge as significant factors influencing student performance, the analysis underscores the complexity of academic achievement. Gender disparities, as revealed in the comparison of math, reading, and writing scores, demonstrate the societal dynamics affecting educational outcomes. Moreover, the correlation between parental education levels and student success underscores the relationship between family background and academic achievement. Additionally, the visible contrast in performance between students who underwent test preparation and those who did not underscores the pivotal role of access to resources and opportunities. Together, these findings illuminate the multifaceted nature of student performance, urging a holistic approach to understanding and addressing the factors shaping educational outcomes.

# Discussion and Summary
Upon further investigation beyond this dataset, I uncovered similar results regarding the most significant factors impacting a student's performance. It is widely acknowledged that one of the most influential factors is the student's environment and social support network. "For example, if a person is surrounded by supportive and encouraging people who value learning and education, they may be more motivated to learn." [classplusapp.com](https://classplusapp.com/growth/factors-that-affects-student-ability-to-learn/?session=ondemand) This reaffirms the importance of parental education. If a parent has completed a certain level of education, they will expect and encourage their child to do the same, thereby fostering a motivating environment. The same source also asserts, "From genetic traits inherited by their parents to environmental influences within classrooms, numerous elements can shape the learning experiences of students."[classplusapp.com](https://classplusapp.com/growth/factors-that-affects-student-ability-to-learn/?session=ondemand). This further underscores the significance of parental education in determining a student's performance. 

I next decided to involve generative AI in my research. I asked Chat GPT my focus question, "What factors may cause certain students to perform better than others?". Chat GPT returned a bulleted list of several factors that can influence why certain students perform better than others. Some of these factors include "Individual Abilities," "Learning Environment," "Parental Involvement and Support," " Socioeconomic Status," and "Cultural and Personal Factors.". Specifically, the socioeconomic status section states, "such as family income, parental education level, access to resources, and neighborhood environment, can influence student performance. " This includes both parents' education level and test preparation factors that I analyzed. Incorporating generative AI into my research provided valuable insights into the multifaceted factors influencing student performance, shedding light on the importance of socioeconomic status, parental involvement, and cultural considerations.

The combination of traditional research methods and generative AI analysis yielded a comprehensive understanding of the various factors influencing a student's performance. By analyzing  findings from external research sources with insights generated by Chat GPT, the significance of environmental factors, parental involvement, and socioeconomic status in shaping academic outcomes became unequivocally clear.
