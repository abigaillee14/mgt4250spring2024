## Project Description
### Question of interest
- What factors may cause certain students to perform better than others?
### Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because
 1. A student's school performance tells of their success later in life and potential careers. 
 2. “Academic performance is important for students as a result of educational experience in colleges to represent knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Academic performance becomes one of the key factors in determining students’ success in their future careers.”  [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2022.2101326#:~:text=Academic%20performance%20is%20important%20for,success%20in%20their%20future%20careers)
